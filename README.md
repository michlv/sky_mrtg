# sky_mrtg
This repository is for a few scripts to scrape some stats from Sky routers and feed them to MRTG.

Should work ER110, ER115 and with SR101, SR102 with a small modification.

ER110 & ER115 support 2.4 & 5GHz Wifi, whereas SR101 & SR102 only supports 2.4Ghz, so change in parsing is needed.
